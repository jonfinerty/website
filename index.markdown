Hi, I'm Jon and this is my website.

It's intended audience is me. 

I think that writing things down can help solidify and export thoughts from your brain and stop them banging around in your head. I intend to post-and-ghost[^ghost]. My writing will contradict itself and the beliefs will clash, but I think that's ok. I'd rather put stuff down in ink and be wrong, then never write. 

Absorb what is useful, discard what is not.

### Notes[^footnotes] 

[^ghost]: I have a couple of rules for myself on the internet:  
    - Only interact positively, no good comes from public negativity. 
    - Everyone wants to addict you to their feed, avoid scrolling.  

    Better to put stuff out, interact mindfully and get on with life.


[^footnotes]: Because this is a website for me, I've decided to add copious amounts of footnotes. In theory so I can be as tangential as I like, but mostly to emulate my favourite author: [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett)
