I have a few core beliefs. Things that even if they aren't true, I wish they were and I try to act accordingly. 

Firstly I think competency is a transferable skill. Getting good at one thing, or better yet, many things, makes you better at whatever the next challenge is. Secondly being practical is virtue. Given time, patience and the willingness to get a few bruises you should be able to do-it-yourself. Thirdly, breadth of experience makes us better people, it builds empathy, understanding and let's you draw patterns from the chaos of life. Lastly, and something I have to actively practice as a natural computer hermit, is you should try new things. Make plans, have projects, keep momentum in life, compound interest is everywhere.

A short piece of writing that crystallises this outlook and one I have become attached to is by [Robert A. Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein), a science fiction author you will know from Starship Troopers. It's an extract from one of his works and often called [The Competent Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein#The_Competent_Man), where a character gives a list of requirements:

> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.

This isn't the first time I've thought about it. I wrote a [version for software engineers](https://medium.com/@jonfinerty/the-competent-developer-a03e23a9cfc8), applying my polymathmatics beliefs to my job.

So, in order to keep my momentum and stave off boredeom, I thought why not go further and try to complete the original competencies. So here we go, a checklist.

## What's next?

I have a 4-day sailing course booked that promises *"once completed you will have the basic knowledge to hire or sail your own boat without an instructor onboard"*. Which should tick off 'Conn a ship'. Some will prove more tricky than others, comfort the dying and dying gallantly both will (hopefully!) require some nuanced intrepretation.
